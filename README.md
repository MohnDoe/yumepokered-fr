Pokémon Yume 夢 is an enhancement hack of Pokémon Red and Blue built on the [pokered disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokered).
It aims to enrich the originals with improved gameplay balance, greater Pokémon accessibility, and carefully integrated additions that feel as though they were always meant to be there.
Above all, it seeks to preserve the charm and spirit of these games.

夢 (Yume), meaning dream, symbolizes a return to Kanto where the line between memory and reimagination blurs.
Loosely inspired by the anime, manga, and later Pokémon generations, Yume features expanded storylines, new areas, and subtle cultural touches highlighting the games' Japanese roots.

### Gameplay updates

**Moves**

- Consult the [complete list of move changes](docs/move_changes.md) for more info!
- Ghost is now a Special type, and Dragon a Physical type.
- Fix for Focus energy and Dire hit. (Quadruple critical hit rate instead of dividing it by 4.)

**Learnsets**
- Pokémon learnsets have been revamped in the same spirit: to give more options while trying to maintain Gen 1 authenticity.
- The new learnsets can be consulted in this [file](data/pokemon/evos_moves.asm).

- Fixed badge boost glitch and Leech Seed/Toxic exploit.

- Rematches for Gym leaders and the Elite 4 with stronger teams and movesets.

**Wild encounters**
- Wild encounters have been reworked to increase diversity and make many Pokémon available earlier in the game.
- For full details (spoilers!), see the files for [wild encounters on each map](data/wild/maps) and their [probabilities](data/wild/probabilities.asm).
- Every fishing rod is available earlier than it was in the original games.
- Fishing encounters were completely reworked in terms of levels and Pokémon diversity.
- For full details (spoilers!), see the files for the [Old rod](data/wild/old_rod.asm), [Good rod](data/wild/good_rod.asm) and [Super rod](data/wild/super_rod.asm).
- The Area feature of the Pokédex now shows Land, Surf, and Fishing encounters separately.

## Version differences

Differences between versions are minimal.  
- Version-exclusive Pokémon are now handled as rarity differences instead of being completely unavailable in the other version.  
  For instance, in the original games, Oddish was exclusive to Red, while Bellsprout was exclusive to Blue.
  In Yume, they are obtainable in all versions, but Oddish is more common in Red and Bellsprout is more common in Blue.  
  Green version shares the same encounter tables as Blue.
  
Other differences remain as in the original games:
- Game Boy Color palettes: Red/Green for Red, Green/Red for Green, Blue/Red for Blue.
- Game Corner slots: different visual designs.
- Super Game Boy: different border graphics.

Unless you’re after an easier hunt for a specific version-exclusive Pokémon, just pick whichever color you like!
